### Asset-Sharing 3D Model Collaboration

Sourceduty wants to collaborate with another small business, brand, or artist to customize and sell modified 3D model assets specifically designed for 3D printing, leveraging the Cults3D Marketplace platform. The collaboration aims to combine distinctive styles or expertise to create unique, customized 3D models.

A collaboration with Sourceduty involves partnering with entities that bring complementary skills, aesthetics, or innovations to the table, enhancing the overall value proposition of the 3D models. A key component of this strategy is the asset-sharing model, which necessitates clear agreements on the distribution of the collaborative 3D model assets to ensure fairness and transparency.

### Design Contributions

Contributions can be quantified in terms of time spent, the complexity of the work, and the level of expertise required. More complex designs that require a higher level of skill or longer hours to create might warrant a larger share of the revenue. If one collaborator's style, business or brand has a strong market presence or following, this might increase the value of their contribution.

### Work Agreement

Document everything in a clear, legally binding agreement. This contract should cover all aspects of the collaboration, including the revenue sharing model, roles and responsibilities, intellectual property rights, dispute resolution mechanisms, and plans for exiting the partnership. Transparency, fairness, and clear communication are crucial.

### Asset-Sharing

In this collaboration, every collaborative 3D model is alternately distributed between two parties: one being Sourceduty and the other being a different business, brand, or artist. Sourceduty receives every other 3D model for their purposes, while the intervening models are sent to the other collaborator for their creative contributions. This alternating distribution ensures that both Sourceduty and its partner have equal opportunities to influence the design of the collaborative 3D models.

The alternating distribution of collaborative 3D models between Sourceduty and the other collaborators provides a clear, structured system that can prevent or resolve financial disputes. By having an agreed-upon pattern for sharing the models, each party knows exactly what to expect and can plan their monetization strategies accordingly. This system minimizes the potential for disagreements over who owns what, as each party receives an equal share of the creative output, which they can then use for their own financial gain, thereby reducing conflicts over revenue sharing or intellectual property rights.
